<p>A major hurdle in the success of any content management system (CMS) or web platform is the lack of user training and understanding, particularly among the authors who are expected to use the system daily. When authors are not adequately trained or familiarized with the system, it leads to inefficiencies, errors, and frustration. Content creation and management become arduous tasks, and the quality of the output suffers as a result. This lack of proficiency can cause delays in content updates, inconsistencies in presentation, and ultimately a decrease in user engagement and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The root of this problem often lies in inadequate onboarding and ongoing support for authors. Without comprehensive training sessions, clear documentation, and accessible support resources, authors struggle to navigate the systemâ€™s functionalities. They may resort to workarounds that can introduce errors or bypass best practices, further complicating the content management process. Additionally, if authors feel unsupported and overwhelmed by the system's complexity, their productivity and morale can decline sharply. Ensuring that authors are well-equipped with the necessary skills and resources to use the system effectively is essential. This includes not only initial training but also continuous education and support, enabling authors to leverage the full potential of the system and contribute to the platform's success confidently and efficiently.</p>
