      <p class="copy-paragraph"><p>You’ve set aside the budget and signed the contracts, but did you remember to budget enough time for your people to contribute? The first couple of months of a CMS project requires dedicated time from all of the people involved. We call this phase project discovery.
Your people probably already have a full plate. Unless they are already highly invested in the outcome of the project, they won’t be keen to carve out valuable time to contribute. Before the project, set proper expectations and give your people some space to breathe so they can temporarily shift their priorities. What you don’t want is your agency partner trying to schedule meetings with stakeholders that have no availability, causing frustration and delays.</p>
