    <p>How to Avoid Over-structuring Your Content </p>
    <p class="copy-paragraph"><p>You need an appropriate content model, which is an early draft of how content will be structured with its attributes and shared relationships.</p>
<p>But you can’t flip a switch and pop out a content model for your organization. It requires lots of research, interviews with stakeholders and users, and soul-searching in order to prioritize the proper things. It also must map onto your Content Management System. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to use it to structure your content.</p>
<p>Ideal content models are like DNA: no two organizations have the same one. A content model that works great for one organization will cause mass confusion (or worse) at another organization. Trying to import a foreign content model is like trying to transfuse the blood of a horse to a human and expecting everything to work properly.</p>
<p>So how do you find the right way to structure your content? Like Goldilocks trying porridge, we want it just right.</p>
