      <p class="copy-paragraph"><p>The only way to find out what will work for your organization is to talk to the people who make up your organization. And then, talk to users of your website and find out what their needs and pain points are. Remember, however, not to ignore your internal users.</p>
<p>Some questions to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the primary audience of your site?</li>
<li>What are the most important kinds of information currently on the website?</li>
<li>What does your current content authoring process look like? Can you talk us through it?</li>
<li>Who creates and manages content? Is it a particular role or a mix of people?</li>
</ul>
<p>To prevent adding structure you don’t need, keep asking, “why?” A stakeholder might demand more flexibility for a content type, which will require you to add more fields, options, and functionality. But if you dig into the reasoning behind the request, you might find there is a simpler answer to their problem.</p>
