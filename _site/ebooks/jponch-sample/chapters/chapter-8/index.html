    <p class="copy-paragraph"><h1>Too much complexity</h1>
<p>A significant barrier to the success of many projects is the introduction of excessive complexity. When systems, processes, or features become overly complex, they can overwhelm both the development team and the end-users. This complexity often arises from trying to incorporate too many features, catering to a wide range of use cases, or failing to prioritize simplicity and usability. As a result, the project becomes difficult to manage, develop, and maintain, leading to increased costs, extended timelines, and a higher likelihood of errors.</p>
