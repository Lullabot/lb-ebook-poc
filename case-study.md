# Transforming eBooks: From PDFs to Accessible Web Experiences

When it comes to digital content, accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have - it's essential. That's why we recently took on the challenge of transforming our valuable eBook collection from PDFs into a fully accessible web format. Let's dive into how we tackled this project and the lessons we learned along the way.

## The Challenge: Beyond PDFs

PDFs have their place, but they often fall short when it comes to accessibility, especially for users relying on screen readers or other [assistive technologies](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/you-dont-have-pdf-problem-you-have-workflow-problem). We knew we needed to do better. Our goals were clear:

1. Convert PDF content to a web-friendly, accessible format
2. Maintain the visual appeal of the original eBooks
3. Ensure a consistent layout across devices
4. Implement intuitive navigation for both desktop and mobile

## Our Solution: A Custom Web-Based Platform

To meet these challenges head-on, we developed a custom web-based eBook platform. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. Content Structure
We restructured our content using Markdown, which gave us the best of both worlds - easy conversion to HTML and a clean, readable format for [our content editors](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/benefits-structured-content). Each eBook was split into separate Markdown files for the cover, table of contents, and individual pages.
2. Responsive Layout
Using Sass, we crafted a responsive layout that looks great on screens of all sizes. No more pinching and zooming on mobile!
3. Accessible Navigation
We created a sidebar navigation that's not only visually appealing but also keyboard-accessible and screen reader-friendly. Users can easily move between pages and access the table of contents.
4. Custom Fonts
To maintain our visual identity, we implemented custom fonts using @font-face rules. This ensures consistent typography across different devices and browsers.
5. Image Handling
We didn't forget about visual content. All images now include appropriate [alt text](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/writing-better-alt-text), ensuring they're described for users relying on screen readers.
6. Build Process
We implemented a build process using Eleventy, a static site generator. This compiles our Markdown files into HTML and optimizes assets for production.

## The Results: A Win for Accessibility and UX

Our new web-based eBook format has delivered some significant improvements:

1. Increased Accessibility: Our content is now fully accessible to users with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
2. Improved User Experience: Navigation between pages and chapters is more intuitive and faster than in the PDF format.
3. Better Mobile Experience: The responsive design ensures a great reading experience on all devices.
4. Easier Content Updates: Using Markdown for content makes it easier for our team to update and maintain the eBooks.
5. Improved SEO: The web-based format allows search engines to index the content, potentially increasing discoverability.

## Wrapping Up: Lessons Learned

This project reinforced for us the importance of considering accessibility in all aspects of content delivery. It also showcased how modern web technologies can be leveraged to [create inclusive, user-friendly experiences](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/web-accessibility-how-inclusivity-protects-your-business-and-your-bottom-line).
By transforming our eBooks from PDF to a custom web-based format, we've not only improved accessibility and user experience but also set a new standard for our content delivery. We're excited to apply these lessons to future projects and continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital content strategy.
