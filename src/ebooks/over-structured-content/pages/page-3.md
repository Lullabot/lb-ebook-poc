Documentation is necessary. But often, documentation is used as a bandaid to cover up bad UI. Instead of working to craft a structure that feels right and makes sense, more pages of documentation are added because thatâ€™s the easier task. Even though no one seems to like writing documentation, many would rather write it than start digging deeper into the problems of how the CMS is set up and how the content is structured. There be dragons.
