Once content is ready to publish, does it take a long time to finally get on the website? Longer than you think it should? There are many possible reasons for this, but one of them might be because of complications introduced by too much structure. Sometimes this is caused by performance problems from nested fields and relationships. One of our clients had to wait 20-30 seconds for a pop-up to load, and many pages required using that pop-up ten to twenty times to get ready.
