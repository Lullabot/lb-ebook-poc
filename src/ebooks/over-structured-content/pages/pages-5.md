title: "Lots of unused fields and content types"

If, after six months, you have a field or content type that has never been used, that’s a sign you got overzealous in your structuring. You tried to solve a problem that didn’t exist, your solution was unhelpful, or it’s too hard for editors to get the required information. Time to start asking some more questions.

For example, an organization might have an event content type and one stakeholder has a dream of doing event series. There are a few extra fields to relate events to each other and to a series entity. Five years later, the initiative still hasn’t materialized, and these fields remain empty.
