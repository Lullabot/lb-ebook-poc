During interviews and workshops, while mapping out the domain your business is a part of, you could find yourself structuring content that doesn’t need it. Since knowledge likes to be connected, this is easy to do.

For example, you could have a website about music that has objects for artists and albums. Each album has a list of tracks. Can that list be text items, or should there be an object of type track? If so, does it have the duration and lyrics attached? Does it also have the songwriters? If it has the songwriters, should they just be text, or do you need another object for them because you want to attach a bio, or can you reuse your artist object?

You can fall into a similar spiral if you also want to include concerts an artist is performing at. How much information do you need to attach to concert venues and locations? Nearby hotels or restaurants? A brief description or history? It’s easy to keep diving down into more and more structure, and then suddenly realize you’ve started mapping out bird migratory patterns for your music website.

When you find yourself going down these rabbit holes, take a step back and reassess.
