# The People who Use the Site the Most Are Never Consulted

This problem comes in two flavors, and projects can have both.
The primary audience—actual end users—was never asked what they needed or what actions they perform when using the website. Do they even want a website at all?
The internal users, those who create, edit, and manage the site content, aren’t asked what sorts of features and options would best support their workflows and ability to communicate with their audience.
Higher-ups who have authority and control of the budget are almost never left out, but they often have an unrealistic or skewed picture of what the website needs. They aren’t using the CMS every day. They aren’t fielding support requests and questions from the audience.
This can lead to disillusionment after launch as the people who use the CMS the most find it unhelpful. What was supposed to make content management easier ends up being another roadblock.
