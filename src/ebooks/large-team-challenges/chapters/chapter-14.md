You have a large content team because you need to publish and manage a lot
of content. But large content teams have challenges that must be overcome
so your content pipeline keeps flowing. These challenges can be addressed
as long as you don’t jump immediately to a technological solution or don’t
immediately assume that adding more people will help fix the problem.

Be prepared to look at the bigger picture first before diving in deep.down the
road. The more you listen to and implement feedback, the more trust you
build.

This all pays off with greater buy-in and acceptance as your project rolls out
and, since many of your stakeholders will already have some familiarity with
what you’re doing, easier training.

**We’ve helped [many organizations](https://www.lullabot.com/our-work) overcome challenges similar to yours.
