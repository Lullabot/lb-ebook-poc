If you are going through a re-platforming or a website upgrade, start
thinking about these challenges as soon as possible. Strategy and
[design expertise can offer valuable insights](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/presentation-modeling-prioritized-user-centered-approach-design-requirements-gathering) before you start pouring the concrete.
In addition, developers can help you determine feasibility within your
budget to help you prioritize the proper technological tools.

Get a good map of the landscape before starting your journey. It’s beneficial
to [run a lot of exercises](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/squiggles-straight-lines-sketching-during-strategy-and-ux-work) to help [uncover potential problems](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/beyond-discovery-designing-a-more-valuable-phase-one) and
to [make sure every voice is heard](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/why-we-advocate-paper-prototyping-digital-content), all before a single line of code has been written.
