Some editors may only hop in every few weeks or every few months. They
don’t use it enough to grasp the complexities and end up making mistakes,
and if they have permissions they don’t need, some of those mistakes could
be catastrophic. The UX can also become overwhelming.

### SOLUTIONS

- **Limit the number of editors**. This problem of infrequent users might
be a sign that too many people have access to change the website. More
rigorous processes might help.
- **Approval workflows**. This is an area where strict approval workflow
helps. Nothing gets published unless it has been reviewed and approved
by someone who is an expert at working with the website.
- **Easy ways to get help**. Slack channels dedicated to content entry on the
website are incredibly useful. Anyone can go there to get support.
- **Simplified UX**. Hide infrequently used form elements under an
“advanced” section. Limit permissions to site-wide configuration pages.
Create a simple, dedicated menu just for content editors.
