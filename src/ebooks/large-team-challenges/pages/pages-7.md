How many gates does a piece of content need to pass through before it gets
published? If there are not enough people with approval permissions, things
can pile up fast. If one gatekeeper is overtaxed, even smaller teams can
struggle to get a small amount of content flowing through the pipeline.

### SOLUTIONS

- **Determine if the workflow is really needed**. Is it meeting your needs, or
is it just causing more pain? Is it really necessary? Is the workflow there
because there is a low level of trust? Is the workflow there because of
silly mistakes caused by confusing UX or lack of training? There might
be a deeper issue.
- **Separate pipelines and responsibilities**. If everything is currently stuffed
into one workflow, see if there is a way to separate them. This works best
if content editor responsibilities fall cleanly along the lines of different
content types, so you might want to look at shifting responsibilities before
attempting. [Workbench Access](https://www.drupal.org/project/workbench_access) sometimes helps in these situations.
