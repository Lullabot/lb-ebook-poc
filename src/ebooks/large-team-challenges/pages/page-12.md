title: Don't assume every problem has a technological solution

Jumping immediately to a technological solution can sometimes be like
adding elaborate locks on a door when there’s a gaping hole in the wall right
next to it. If your content teams don’t trust each other, implementing a strict
approval workflow on your website won’t solve the problem. It might hide it
for a little while, but that’s it.

A well-built form will have the correct help messages and error checks to
help prevent editors from making silly mistakes. A well-built form is not
a replacement for training. Nor can it replace deep knowledge of how the
content model fits together.

One way this has been done is to lock down access to the administration
interface of the website until there’s confirmation that someone has
gone through the documentation and training required. Technology
helps enforce this, but documentation still needs to be kept up to date.
Editors who haven’t logged in for a long time might forget some of the
training. There are all sorts of challenges that have to be addressed at an
organization’s cultural level or at the process level.
