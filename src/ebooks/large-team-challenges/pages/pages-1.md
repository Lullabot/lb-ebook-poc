As your content team grows, so does the potential for new problems. Or, as some call them, “opportunities to work better together.” With more editors comes more ways to bump elbows, cause confusion, and miscommunicate. Still, if you work through these potential problems, your organization will be better off than before, with an unobstructed content pipeline that flows freely. And that’s the end goal, right? A steady stream of quality content gets published on your website, helping your organization reach its most important goals. Then, you expand your team to increase the output to reach those goals faster.

But you want to be aware of the potential problems that larger teams can encounter. If you don’t pay attention, growing your content team could have diminishing returns more quickly than you thought possible. Adding more people doesn’t automatically mean “more output.”
