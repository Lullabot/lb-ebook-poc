In most projects, your goal is not to change the world. The vast majority of the problems you encounter in archipelago projects are organizational and political, which are outside of the official scope. Cultures can take decades to change.

But you can move the needle forward wherever it’s possible, even if it’s just a couple of inches here and there. Next thing you know, you’ve moved a foot, then a yard, then a mile.

Do what you can, figure out how to solve problems in a way that meets everyone’s needs, and don’t give up.
