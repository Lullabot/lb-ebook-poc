You’ve identified your accessibility problems. Now, it’s time to start remediating those problems. Many of the issues discovered, especially using automated tools, will be content-related issues like no alt text on images, broken links, spelling errors, and SEO problems. Consider creating a [content matrix](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/content-matrix-your-re-organized-closet-content) to begin addressing them.

Technical issues sometimes require development. You now have a list to give to your technical team or hand to an external agency for an estimate.

Don’t have the resources to perform this audit on your own or want help with remediation? [Reach out](https://www.lullabot.com/contact). We are happy to help!
