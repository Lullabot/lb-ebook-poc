title: "Making the most of free and paid accessibility tools"

With so many free tools available, why invest in a free one? If your organization’s budget allows, paid tools are worth considering. They have advanced features, identify a broader list of issues, and are easier to use. And if they are easier to use, you’re more likely to use them.

However, if your organization has a limited budget, free tools are still adequate for performing a good audit. Be sure and overlap multiple tools on the same page, as one tool might be better at discovering one type of issue but be weak in another area.

Once the scan is complete, start with the page with the most issues. Create a task for each issue in your project management tool of choice or list them in a document.

This list will be important once you begin remediation.
