### Gather a sample of URLs to test
To kickstart your automated accessibility audit, select at least 50 pages on your website. Aim for a diverse sample that represents as many content types and components as possible. Include forms, tables, accordions, popups, sliders, filters, and anything your users could interact with. The more variety, the better your audit coverage.

Not sure which URLs to test? Check your analytics for your most visited pages. 

### Run automated tests on your URLs
Automated tests are a great starting point for your audit. They canâ€™t catch everything, but they quickly identify key issues and lay the groundwork for deeper manual testing. Here are some examples of the many tools you can choose from, both free and paid.
