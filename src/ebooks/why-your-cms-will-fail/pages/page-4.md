CMS projects are often driven by the need to update outdated technology. This is obviously important. There are security and performance concerns and a desire to access new features.

However, these concerns can overshadow the actual purpose of a site, which is to help its audience do whatever the audience needs to do. You can have a CMS with all the bells and whistles your heart desires, but if those bells and whistles make noises that no one cares about or pays attention to, your project will fail.

**Takeaway:** Keep the real purpose of your project front and center, whether it's helping the business continue making money or aiding the state government in getting information to its citizens efficiently.
