Timelines are often driven by budgets or edicts from higher-ups who do not understand the projectâ€™s needs.

If timelines are bogus, this leads to broken promises and unmatched expectations, leading to a breakdown in trust and communication. Your CMS project might never launch; if it does, it might be held together by duct tape and bubblegum.

**Takeaway:** Ensure plenty of time for discovery to develop a realistic scope based on business and user needs.
