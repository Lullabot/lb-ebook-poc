A CMS project is never done. It is only closer to meeting your goals than it was previously. Not everything can be completed before launch. There are always bugs and new feature requests. Don’t forget about ongoing maintenance to keep all of the software up to date.

If you present the new CMS as a finished product, as if you were delivering a pizza, then people will be frustrated and upset. A large portion of your people will think they got the wrong pizza or they were overcharged, and they won’t be wrong. Remember to set proper expectations and timelines and communicate them clearly. For example, “This feature won’t make it in before launch, but we plan on having it completed before the end of the quarter.”

**Takeaway:** Set proper expectations and communicate timelines with ALL stakeholders.
