You can do everything right, and your project can still derail after launch. If your authors and editors don’t know how to use the new CMS, it doesn’t matter if the project was delivered on time and under budget.

Authors and editors must understand how the new CMS meets the needs they communicated earlier in the project. They’re also the ones who will be best at identifying bugs that need to be fixed and confusing language that needs clarification.

**Takeaway:** Make time for training, answering questions, and receiving ongoing feedback.
