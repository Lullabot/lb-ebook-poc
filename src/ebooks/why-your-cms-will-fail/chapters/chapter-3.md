title: 'Not consulting the people who use the website most'

This problem comes in two flavors, and projects can have both.

- The primary audience—actual end users—was not asked what they needed or what actions they performed when using the website. Do they even want a website at all?
- Those responsible for creating, editing, and managing the site content were not asked what features and options would best support their workflows and facilitate communication with their audience.

Higher-ups with authority and control of the budget are almost never left out of the meetings that decide on website features, but they aren’t using the CMS every day. They aren’t fielding support requests and questions from your primary audience. As a result, they often have an unrealistic or skewed picture of what the website needs.

This can lead to disillusionment after launch, as most people who use the CMS find it unhelpful. What was supposed to make content management easier ends up being another roadblock.

**Takeaway:** Include ALL stakeholders when starting a web project to avoid exacerbating an existing problem.
